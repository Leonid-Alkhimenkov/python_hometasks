ROS 2 Documentation
The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications.
From drivers and state-of-the-art algorithms to powerful developer tools,
ROS has the open source tools you need for your next robotics project.

Since ROS was started in 2007, a lot has changed in the robotics and ROS community.
The goal of the ROS 2 project is to adapt to these changes,
leveraging what is great about ROS 1 and improving what isn’t.

This site contains the documentation for ROS 2.
If you are looking for ROS 1 documentation, check out the ROS wiki.
